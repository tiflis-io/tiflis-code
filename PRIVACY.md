# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: November 2025**

## Overview

Tiflis Code ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Tiflis Code application.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

Tiflis Code is designed with privacy in mind:

- **No telemetry**: We do not collect usage statistics or analytics
- **No tracking**: We do not track your behavior or activities
- **No cloud storage**: Your code and conversations stay on your devices
- **No account required**: You can use Tiflis Code without creating an account

### What Stays Local

All data processed by Tiflis Code remains on your devices:

- Voice recordings and transcriptions
- Chat history with AI agents
- Terminal session logs
- Connection credentials (stored in iOS Keychain)

### Network Communication

Tiflis Code communicates only with:

1. **Your Workstation Server**: Direct connection to your own machine
2. **Your Tunnel Server**: If configured, for remote access to your workstation
3. **AI Provider APIs**: Only from your Workstation Server, not from the mobile app

## Data Security

- All connections use encrypted WebSocket (WSS) protocol
- Authentication keys are stored securely in iOS Keychain
- No data is transmitted to third parties

## Third-Party Services

The Workstation Server may use third-party AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) based on your configuration. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information about how they handle data.

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- Delete chat history at any time
- Clear all local data by uninstalling the app
- Disconnect from workstation to stop all data flow
